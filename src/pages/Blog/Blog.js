                <p>When choosing a modern database, one of the biggest decisions is picking a relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) data structure. While both are viable options, there are key differences between the two that users must keep in mind when making a decision.

                    Here, we break down the most important distinctions and discuss the best SQL and NoSQL database systems available.

                    <strong>The five critical differences between SQL vs NoSQL are:</strong>

                    <li>SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.</li>
                    <li>SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.</li>
                    <li>SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.</li>
                    <li>SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.</li>
                    <li>SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON</li>
